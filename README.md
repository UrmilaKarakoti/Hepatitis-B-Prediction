# Hepatitis-B-Prediction
In this project, we aimed to create a robust solution for identifying cases of Hepatitis B disease using machine learning algorithms. Our expertise in data analysis and algorithm development has been pivotal in achieving accurate and reliable results. Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and early identification plays a crucial role in effective medical intervention.

**Tech Stack**
The following technologies were used in the project:

Machine Learning: We employed various machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can identify Hepatitis B cases based on relevant features.

**Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning project. We utilized techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the raw data for analysis.

**Data Analysis**: Our project heavily relied on data analysis to gain insights from the dataset. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helped us understand the patterns and relationships within the data.

**Getting Started**
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
